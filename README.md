# Autolib-data-for-hypothesis-testing
A project to test the understanding of the concept of hypothesis testing using Python programming

# Technologies Used
Being a data science project, the project required us to perform hypothesis testing and exploratory data analysis as well as the knowledge of various statistical techniques and methods. We will use various libraries to work on our notebook.

# Support and contact details
In case of any querries, corrections or additions, feel free to reach me and share. Corrections are most welcome since I have just begun the journey and being pointed in the right direction would actually go a long way in helping me grow and learn and become a better data scientist. The goal of data is insight and if you find insight that I didn't, do let me know.

This project used data sourced from http://bit.ly/DSCoreAutolibDataset
